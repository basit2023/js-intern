## Topics Covered Today

### 1. **Basic Assignment Operators**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The most commonly used assignment operator is the `=` operator.

- **`=`**: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
  ```js
  let x = 10;
  ```

- **`+=`**: Adds the right-hand value to the left-hand variable and assigns the result.
  ```js
  x += 5;  // Equivalent to x = x + 5;
  ```

- **`-=`**: Subtracts the right-hand value from the left-hand variable and assigns the result.
  ```js
  x -= 3;  // Equivalent to x = x - 3;
  ```

- **Other assignment operators**:
  - **`*=`** (multiplication)
  - **`/=`** (division)
  - **`%=`** (modulus)
  - **`**=`** (exponentiation)

### 2. **Comparison Operators**
Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean (`true` or `false`).

- **`==`**: Checks if two values are equal (ignores type).
  ```js
  5 == '5';  // true
  ```

- **`===`**: Strict equality (checks value and type).
  ```js
  5 === '5';  // false
  ```

- **`!=`**: Checks if two values are not equal.
  ```js
  5 != 6;  // true
  ```

- **`!==`**: Strict inequality (checks value and type).
  ```js
  5 !== '5';  // true
  ```

- **Other comparison operators**:
  - **`>`**: Greater than
  - **`<`**: Less than
  - **`>=`**: Greater than or equal to
  - **`<=`**: Less than or equal to

### 3. **Logical Operators**
Logical operators combine multiple conditions.

- **`&&` (AND)**: True if both conditions are true.
  ```js
  (x > 0 && y > 0);  // true if both x and y are greater than 0
  ```

- **`||` (OR)**: True if at least one condition is true.
  ```js
  (x > 0 || y > 0);  // true if either x or y is greater than 0
  ```

- **`!` (NOT)**: Inverts the condition.
  ```js
  !(x > 0);  // true if x is not greater than 0
  ```
