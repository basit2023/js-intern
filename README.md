This Readme provides instructions for setting up and running a JavaScript script, including the prerequisites and how to run the code on your local machine.

---

## Prerequisites

To run this JavaScript script, you will need the following:

1. **Node.js Installed**:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. You can download and install it from the official website.
   - Verify the installation by running:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - You should see the version number if Node.js is installed correctly.

2. **Code Editor (Optional)**:
   - You can use any code editor to write JavaScript, such as:
     - [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
     - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
     - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
   - This step is optional as you can write JavaScript files using any text editor, but an IDE or code editor will make it easier.

## How to Run the JavaScript Script

1. **Create a New File**:
   - Save your JavaScript code in a file with a `.js` extension, such as `script.js`.

2. **Open a Terminal**:
   - Navigate to the directory where your `script.js` file is located using the terminal (command prompt or shell).

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Use the following command to run your script:
     ```bash
     node script.js
     ```
   - This will execute the JavaScript code using Node.js.
